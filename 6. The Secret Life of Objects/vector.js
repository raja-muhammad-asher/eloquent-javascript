/* A vector type
Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name.

Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (this and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).

// Your code here.

console.log(new Vec(1, 2).plus(new Vec(2, 3)));
// → Vec{x: 3, y: 5}
console.log(new Vec(1, 2).minus(new Vec(2, 3)));
// → Vec{x: -1, y: -1}
console.log(new Vec(3, 4).length);
// → 5 */

class Vec {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  plus(other) {
    return new Vec(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);
  }

  minus(other) {
    return new Vec(this.x - other.x, this.y - other.y);
  }

  get length() {
    return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
  }
}
